## What are Players?

In PoloCloud, a **Player** represents a connected user in your game or application. Players are tracked across services and provide information about their current status and location.

<div className="text-center mb-12">
    <div className="w-20 h-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-primary/50 to-transparent rounded-full mx-auto mb-6" />
    <div className="text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        Track and manage connected players across your services
    </div>
</div>

### Player Information

- **Name** - Player's username
- **UUID** - Unique player identifier
- **Current Service** - Which service the player is currently on
- **Connection Status** - Online/offline state

## Working with Players

### Getting the Player Provider

First, get access to the player provider using the PoloCloud Rust SDK:

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="rust" code={`use polocloud_sdk::PoloCloudSDK;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let sdk = PoloCloudSDK::new().await?;
    let player_provider = sdk.player_provider();
    
    // Your player operations here
    
    Ok(())
}`} />

### Finding Players

Discover players in your cloud infrastructure:

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="rust" code={`// Find all players
let mut player_provider = sdk.player_provider().lock().await?;
let all_players = player_provider.find_all_async().await?;

// Find player by name
let player_name = "Player123".to_string();
let player = player_provider.find_by_name_async(player_name).await?;

// Find players by service
let service_name = "lobby-1".to_string();
let service_players = player_provider.find_by_service_async(service_name).await?;

// Print results
println!("Found {} players:", all_players.len());
for player in all_players {
    println!("- {} (UUID: {}) on service: {}", 
             player.name(), 
             player.uuid(), 
             player.curren_service_name());
}`} />

### Player Properties

Players in the Rust SDK have the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `name()` | `&str` | Player username |
| `uuid()` | `&str` | Unique player identifier |
| `curren_service_name()` | `&str` | Current service name |

**Best Practice**

Monitor player counts and distribution across services to optimize resource allocation and ensure good player experience.
