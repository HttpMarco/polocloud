## Managing Services

PoloCloud provides powerful service management commands to control and monitor your Minecraft server instances. Each service represents a running server that belongs to a specific group.

### service list
Lists all currently running services with their status, hostname, port, and properties count.

**Example:**
```bash
service list
```

**Output:**
```
Found 3 services:
 - lobby-1 (state=STARTING hostname=127.0.0.1 port=30000 properties-count=1)
 - test-1 (state=STARTING hostname=127.0.0.1 port=30001 properties-count=0)
 - proxy-1 (state=STARTING hostname=0.0.0.0 port=25565 properties-count=0)
```

### service &lt;service&gt;
Shows detailed information about a specific service including state, group, port, hostname, players, memory usage, and properties.

**Example:**
```bash
service lobby-1
```

**Output:**
```
Service lobby-1:
 - State: STARTING
 - Group: lobby-1
 - Port: 30000
 - Hostname: 127.0.0.1
 - Players: -1/-1
 - Motd: 
 - Memory: 1361.0Mb
 - Cpu usage: 2.07%
 - Properties:
   - fallback: true
```

### service &lt;service&gt; shutdown
Gracefully stops a specific service. The service will save its state and shut down cleanly.

**Example:**
```bash
service proxy-1 shutdown
```

**What happens:**
- Service receives shutdown signal
- All players are disconnected gracefully
- World data is saved
- Service process is terminated
- Service is removed from active list

### service &lt;service&gt; logs
Displays real-time logs from a specific service. Shows the complete server startup process and runtime logs.

**Example:**
```bash
service lobby-1 logs
```

**What you'll see:**
- **Server startup process** - Complete boot sequence from Java initialization to plugin loading
- **Java environment details** - Version, VM type, and operating system information  
- **Platform loading** - Paper server version and build information
- **Plugin initialization** - Plugin remapping and loading process with timing
- **Plugin list** - Final list of loaded Bukkit plugins with versions
- **Real-time updates** - Live log streaming as the server runs

### service &lt;service&gt; copy &lt;template&gt;
Creates a new service by copying from an existing template. Useful for quickly setting up similar services.

**Example:**
```bash
service proxy-1 copy proxy-template
```

**Process:**
- Copies all files from template
- Generates unique service ID
- Applies group-specific configuration
- Starts the new service
- Assigns available port

### service &lt;service&gt; execute &lt;command&gt;
Executes a command directly in the service's console. Useful for server administration and player management.

**Example:**
```bash
service lobby-1 execute op jakubxyz
```

**Output:**
```
Executed command on service lobby-1: op jakubxyz
```

**Supported commands:**
- Minecraft server commands (`op`, `deop`, `whitelist`, `ban`, etc.)
- Plugin-specific commands
- Console-only commands
- Batch command execution

### service &lt;service&gt; screen
Opens an interactive screen session for direct console access to the service.

**Example:**
```bash
service proxy-1 screen
```

**Features:**
- Full console access
- Interactive command input
- Real-time output
- Session persistence
- Multiple concurrent sessions
